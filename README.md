# Screenshots to PDF converter

A python GUI program which helps you keep your notes free of extra content. Its main goal is to free your hard drive from zillions of screenshots. The program creates a PDF from all the images from the chosen folder and allows you to trim the pictures so your PDF won't get bloated with MS Teams (or any other meaningless) frame. 

## Running the program

Run `main.py`, choose a folder containing images, and select a frame that you want to save. Everything else is pretty much self-explanatory.
